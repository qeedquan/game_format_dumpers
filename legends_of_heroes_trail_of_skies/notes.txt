PC version (Steam):

First Chapter:
Saved games go in "$USERS\Saved Games\FALCON\ED6"

Game save files are fixed size, normal saves are 212,160 bytes

Save File Offsets:
0x8:     Location of game time, it is 8 bytes long in DOS time format
0x25c88: Money, it is 4 bytes long but the game caps it to be some number of 9s, it can overflow to
         negative value
0x23e40: Start of characters information, the game does not store stats but the level of the character
         is used to derive the stats. Level is 2 byte value which can be up to 65536 but if one
         sets it to that the game can corrupt the character and make all their stats to be very weak.
         To get around this, set the character max level to be 255 and then set it to be 65536, then
         reload the game, this will bypass some sort of "fixup" so one can get high stats
------------------------------------
Second Chapter:
Game save files changed from the first one, normal saves are 177,184 bytes

The trick with modifying the levels to be 255 then 65536 trick doesn't work anymore.
We can modify the ED6_DT22.dat file; this file stores all the stats for levels.
The logic is that it is a lookup table based on your level, ranges from 35 to 100;
anything outside the range is clamped. the values are signed integer

ED6_DT22.dat Offsets:
(Estelle)
Level 35 stat value starts at 0x18CBA
Level 100 stat value starts at 0x1906f

Save File Offsets:
0x2534c: Money (4 bytes signed)

0x1f44c: Start location of stats
------------------------------------
Third Chapter:
Game save files changed from first/second one, normal saves are 184,176 bytes in size

ED6_DT22.dat Offsets:
0x156a4: Start of stats

Fill with 128 bytes of 0x3f to get good stats for Kevin at the start of stats

Save File Offsets:
0x26bcc: Money (4 bytes signed)

0x1f66c: Start location of stats

Min valid level is 3, max is 150
Level value can be displayed up to 65536 but the stat data loaded from the ED6_DT22.dat
is clamped to min and max valid levels

Experience needed to reach next level is calculated by 10*(Level+1)*(Level+1)

sizeof(Stat) = 0x3c
