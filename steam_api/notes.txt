*** Unreal

Unreal engine standard save format is called GVAS (binary format)

https://github.com/RyudoSynbios/game-tools-collection

*** Unity

Newer Unity games pack the executables that can be extracted using:
https://github.com/Perfare/Il2CppDumper

The newer Unity games will have a file "global-metadata.dat" somewhere
# Extract the data
Il2CppDumper.exe GameAssembly.dll global-metadata.dat

The tool will generate header/data files that describe the entry points of various C# -> C++ functions in the GameAssembly.dll
Use Ghidra/IDA to import the GameAssembly.dll file and then use the ghidra.py script provided by Il2CppDumper
to import those files to map the function names to addresses.

The tool can also generate dummy C# DLLs files that can be viewed in the .NET decompiler.
There is no code in the dummy DLL, only signatures that give information about data structures and function signatures.

Older unity games do not pack the executables, the game code is usually inside Assembly-Csharp.dll

Avalonia is the UNIX/Linux portable version (executable called ILSpy)

*** Golberg Steam API

Goldberg steam save files are stored in %USERS%/AppData/Roaming/Goldberg SteamEmu Saves

*** Proton

Proton can be configured to be used inside the Linux Steam UI
Steam installs proton/games inside $STEAM_PATH/.steam/steam/steamapps/common

# Run from command line

# If steam is installed using snap
export STEAM_PATH=$HOME/snap/steam/common
# If steam is installed from valve
export STEAM_PATH=$HOME

export STEAM_COMPAT_CLIENT_INSTALL_PATH=$STEAM_PATH/.steam/steam
export STEAM_COMPAT_DATA_PATH=$STEAM_PATH/.steam/steam/steamapps/compatdata/
"$STEAM_PATH/.steam/steam/steamapps/common/Proton - Experimental/proton" run App.exe

# Proton uses the following path for the Windows root filesystem
$STEAM_PATH/.local/share/Steam/steamapps/compatdata/pfx/drive_c
